This is a Kafka producer that reads log messages from Splunk HEC and writes to a Kafka topic

In this snippet:

*Replace <splunk-hec-url> with the actual URL of your Splunk HEC endpoint.
*Replace YOUR_SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN with your Splunk HEC token.
*Modify localhost:9092 in kafka_bootstrap_servers with the actual Kafka bootstrap servers' addresses.
*Set kafka_topic to the desired Kafka topic to which you want to publish the messages.
*Make sure to install the confluent-kafka-python library if you haven't already by running pip install confluent-kafka.

*This code reads messages from Splunk HEC using a GET request and the Splunk HEC token for authentication. It then sends each message as a JSON string to the specified Kafka topic using the Kafka producer.

*This is a basic script and it needs error handling and retry mechanism to be added to it.
